A permissive-but-purpose-aligned license set for projects where mission integrity matters.

## The Challenge

Open source has transformed software, but mission-driven organizations face a dilemma: how to remain open while protecting against value drift or misuse by actors with opposing values.

## Our Approach

We're developing a license family that:
- Preserves the core freedoms of open source (use, modify, distribute)
- Includes mission-aligned restrictions (e.g., use must align with biblical values)
- Provides legal clarity for both creators and users
- Offers tiered options from permissive to restrictive

## Inspiration

Drawing from biblical principles of stewardship, integrity, and faithful use of resources, while learning from existing licenses like Creative Commons and GPL.

## Current Work

Legal research, community consultation, and drafting initial license text. We're committed to getting this right—legally sound, theologically grounded, and practically useful.

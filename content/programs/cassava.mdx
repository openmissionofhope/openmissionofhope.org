Cassava feeds hundreds of millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, but improperly processed roots contain cyanogenic compounds that cause konzo and other chronic illnesses. Howard Bradbury's wetting method is a simple, proven technique that removes these toxins.

## The Method

Bradbury's wetting method requires only water and sunlight:
1. Grate or crush the cassava roots
2. Spread thinly and wet thoroughly
3. Dry in the sun for two hours

This process reduces cyanide levels to safe thresholds without expensive equipment.

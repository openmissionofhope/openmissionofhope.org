Millions of people live in places that don't appear on any map. Without addresses, they can't receive mail, prove residency, or get emergency services. Community Addresses is an open overlay on OpenStreetMap that lets communities map themselves.

## How It Works

- **Community-driven**: Local mappers add addresses using mobile phones and GPS
- **OSM-compatible**: Data is structured as an unofficial overlay on OpenStreetMap
- **Open data**: All address data is freely available for anyone to use
- **Offline-capable**: Tools work in areas with limited connectivity

## Why It Matters

Addresses are infrastructure. Without them:
- Emergency services can't find you
- Deliveries can't reach you
- Government services can't serve you
- You can't prove where you live

Community Addresses gives communities the power to put themselves on the map.

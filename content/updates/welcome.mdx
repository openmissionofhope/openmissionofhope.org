---

Welcome to Open Mission of Hope. We're building something different: humanitarian infrastructure that's radically transparent, completely open-source, and rooted in biblical values.

## Why We Exist

The world needs more mercy work—but it also needs better mercy work. Too often, humanitarian efforts suffer from:
- Opaque finances that erode donor trust
- Proprietary tools that create vendor lock-in
- Top-down approaches that ignore local knowledge
- Mission drift that compromises founding values

We believe there's a better way.

## What We're Building

### Active Programs

We're launching with three active programs:

**Prayer Site** surfaces urgent global needs, curated by human editors with AI assistance. Weekly alerts help believers pray with specificity.

**Maisha** is a knowledge commons for health, WASH, and resilience—curated by regional editors in Sub-Saharan Africa, hosted by us.

**NaloxoneForAll** supports community-led overdose response with training, kits, and transparent reporting.

### The Incubator

Our incubator holds projects in development, with **Toivo** at the top: a blockchain-based platform for transparent donations and disbursements. Every dollar traceable from donor to impact.

## Our Approach

We don't directly operate most programs. Instead, we build infrastructure that enables others to serve well:
- Open-source tools anyone can use
- Standards that preserve mission integrity
- Coordination for community-led work
- Transparency systems that make accountability automatic

## Why Open Source?

Mercy work is too important for proprietary lock-in. When humanitarian tools are open-source:
- Anyone can audit the code
- Communities can adapt tools to their context
- No vendor lock-in traps organizations
- Trust is built through transparency

## Why Blockchain?

For Toivo, we chose blockchain not because it's trendy, but because it solves a real problem: trust. An immutable, public ledger means:
- Donations can't be hidden or altered
- Fund flows are automatically documented
- Verification doesn't require trusting intermediaries
- Transparency is the default, not an aspiration

## What's Next

Over the coming months, we'll be:
1. Launching Prayer Site with our first curated alerts
2. Onboarding regional editors for Maisha
3. Establishing NaloxoneForAll coordinator partnerships
4. Prototyping Toivo smart contracts
5. Drafting the Christian Open Source License

## Get Involved

This work belongs to the global church, not to us alone. We welcome:
- **Developers** to build tools
- **Editors** to curate content
- **Donors** to fund operations
- **Partners** to deploy programs
- **Pray-ers** to intercede

*"Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world."* — James 1:27

Let's build systems worthy of that calling.

Our prayer hub surfaces urgent needs worldwide. AI helps us scan signals; a human editor curates weekly, adds scripture, and links to trusted updates.

## How It Works

Each week, our system monitors global news and humanitarian signals. A dedicated editor reviews these alerts, adds scriptural context, and publishes curated prayer requests that help believers pray with specificity and faith.

## Get Involved

Subscribe to receive weekly prayer alerts, or volunteer as a regional prayer editor to help curate needs from your area.

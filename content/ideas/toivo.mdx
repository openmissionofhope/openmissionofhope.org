Toivo will be the blockchain spine: donations in, receipts out, milestone-based disbursements, and public dashboards.

## Vision

Every dollar given for humanitarian work should be traceable from donor to impact. Toivo uses blockchain technology to create immutable records of donations, disbursements, and outcomes—making charity transparent by default.

## How It Will Work

1. **Donate**: Contributors receive instant blockchain receipts
2. **Track**: Funds are released based on verified milestones
3. **Verify**: Public dashboards show real-time fund flows
4. **Impact**: Connect donations directly to documented outcomes

## Why Blockchain?

Traditional charity often lacks transparency. Blockchain provides an immutable, public ledger that can't be altered—building trust through technology.

## Current Status

We're researching the best blockchain platforms and designing the smart contract architecture. Early prototypes are in development.

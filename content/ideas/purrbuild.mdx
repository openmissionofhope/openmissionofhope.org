Board + digital modules that illustrate entropy vs. order, incentives, and the power of honest systems.

## The Concept

PurrBuild is an educational game that simulates community rebuilding after crisis or in fragile states. Players make decisions about resource allocation, trust-building, infrastructure development, and governance—and see the consequences unfold.

## What Players Learn

- **Systems Thinking**: How infrastructure, health, and governance interconnect
- **Incentive Design**: Why good intentions aren't enough without aligned incentives
- **Trust Dynamics**: How trust is built slowly and destroyed quickly
- **Transparency's Power**: The practical benefits of honest, open systems
- **Long-term Thinking**: Balancing immediate needs with sustainable solutions

## Design Philosophy

Combining board game tactility with digital simulation depth. The physical components create social engagement, while digital modules handle complex calculations and scenarios.

## Why "PurrBuild"?

Developed by Pawprint Studio, the name evokes both construction (building) and the patient, persistent work of restoration (purring as a healing vibration).

## Current Status

Prototype development in partnership with humanitarian practitioners and game designers. Testing with education and training organizations.

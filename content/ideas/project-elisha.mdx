Research and prototyping for replicable shelter systems.

## The Need

Disasters and humanitarian crises create immediate housing needs. Current solutions are often expensive, slow, or culturally inappropriate. We believe open-source design can help.

## Vision

Create modular, prefab housing designs that are:
- **Affordable**: Designed for low-cost materials and simple assembly
- **Adaptable**: Modular components that work in different climates and cultures
- **Dignified**: Real homes, not just emergency shelter
- **Replicable**: Open-source plans anyone can build from
- **Sustainable**: Environmentally responsible materials and methods

## Named After Elisha

The prophet Elisha performed miracles of provision and restoration, including preparing a room for a traveling prophet. This project honors that spirit of hospitality and practical care.

## Current Status

Early research phase. We're studying existing prefab systems, consulting with humanitarian architects, and exploring manufacturing partnerships.

## Community Brainstorm Ideas

These are early-stage ideas from our community that need more research, refinement, and validation.

### Essential Pharma Plants

Simple pharmaceutical production facilities in countries with serious need, focusing on essential medicines like:
- Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)
- Basic analgesics (aspirin, paracetamol)
- Antibiotics for common infections
- Essential vitamins and supplements

**Challenge**: Regulatory compliance, quality control, sustainable economics, and avoiding market disruption.

### Christian Free Loan Organization

A faith-based microfinance platform where:
- Depositors receive returns through Proof-of-Stake blockchain rewards rather than interest
- Borrowers receive interest-free loans (aligned with biblical lending principles)
- Blockchain provides transparency and accountability
- Community oversight ensures responsible use

**Challenge**: Regulatory framework, sustainability model, protection against defaults, and ensuring alignment with both biblical principles and modern financial regulations.

In conflict zones and disaster areas, families need to know their loved ones are alive. Heartbeat is a simple check-in system: tap a button to say "I'm OK." Records are stored permanently on Arweave so they can't be altered or erased.

## How It Would Work

1. **Check in**: A simple tap or SMS to confirm you're safe
2. **Notify**: Family and designated contacts receive confirmation
3. **Record**: Each check-in is permanently stored on Arweave
4. **Verify**: Anyone with the right link can verify the record is authentic

## Why Arweave?

In crisis situations, records get lost, altered, or destroyed. Arweave's permanent storage ensures that check-in records persist even if servers go down or regimes change.

## Current Status

Exploring protocol design and partnerships with organizations working in crisis zones.
